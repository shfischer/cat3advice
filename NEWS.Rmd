## 01/03/2024 - Version 0.0.3

Added more functionality for chr rule

* The inverse indicator ratio for component f is now included in `indicator(f)` and can be shown with `inverse_indicator(f)`.

* The inverse indicator ratio can now be plotted with `plot(f, inverse = TRUE)` and this plots mimics the one shown in ICES advice sheets.

## Version 0.0.2

Changes to `advice()` for rfb/rb/chr rule

* Bugfix: the raw values for the rfb/rb/chr calculation in the summary table (before application of the stability clause) are now rounded to the nearest number (e.g. tonne).

## Version 0.0.1

* First version released for ICES assessment season 2023.
