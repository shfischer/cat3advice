\description{
This function defines the reference catch (last advice or average of 
historical catches) for the rfb, rb, and chr rules.
}
\details{
The function accepts as its first argument (`object`):
- a single value representing a reference catch, e.g. the previous catch advice
- a vector of historical values which are used to calculate the average catch
- a data.frame with columns 'year' and either of 'advice', 'catch', 'landings'
- a data.frame with columns 'year', 'advice', 'advice_landings', 'advice_discards'
- an object of class `A`

\code{rfb_A()}, \code{rb_A()}, and \code{chr_A()} are aliases for
\code{A()} in which the \code{hcr} argument is already set to 
'rfb', 'rb', or 'chr'.

The reference catch is set following ICES (2022).

Usually, the reference catch is the previous advised catch. Alternatively,
if the rfb/rb/chr rule is applied the first time, it can be based on an
average of historical catches.

In some cases, discard survival is considered for the rfb/rb/chr rules. In these cases, it can be useful to provide the advice split into landings and discards (provided with columns \code{advice_landings} and \code{advice_discards}) to calculate the assumed dead catch corresponding to the advice. This is done with the discard survival rate provided with the argument \code{discard_survival}.

\examples{
# data.frame with advice/catch history
df <- data.frame(year = 2018:2022,
                 advice = c(3257, 3648, 2721, 2177, 1742),
                 catch = c(2513, 2091, 1887, 1614, NA),
                 landings = c(1880, 1725, 1373, 1403, NA))
# get reference catch (advice)
A <- A(object = df, basis = "advice", units = "tonnes", advice_metric = "catch")
advice(A)
# use average catch
A(object = df, basis = "average catch", avg_years = 3, units = "tonnes", advice_metric = "catch")
