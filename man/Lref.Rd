\description{
This function calculates the reference catch length.
}
\details{
The default is to calculate the MSY proxy reference length following 
Beverton & Holt (1957) and as derived by Jardim et al. (2015):

\code{(theta * Linf + Lc * (gamma + 1)) / (theta + gamma + 1)}

where \code{Linf} is the asymptotic length of a von Bertalanffy growth model,
\code{Lc} the length of first capture, 
theta links von Bertalanffy individual growth parameter k and natural
mortality (M) through \code{k = theta * M} and gamma links fishing mortality 
F to M through \code{F = gamma * M}. The default reference length calculation
assumes \code{theta = 2/3}, i.e. that \code{M/k = 1.5} and that 
\code{gamma = 1}, i.e. that \code{F = M} can be used as a proxy for MSY.
The ratio M/k can be set directly with the argument \code{Mk} or indirectly
with \code{theta} which defaults to \code{1/Mk}.
}
\section{Warning}{
 Changing the default parameters is discouraged. 
Any change to the default parameters should be well justified.

The reference length is usually set once the first time the rfb rule is 
applied and should then be kept constant unless there a substantial changes
in the fishery or fishery selectivity.
